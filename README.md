What is it?
It is an Android to-do list app. Features include adding an item, editting an item by click and deleting an item by long click. It is also an prerequisition for CodePath Project.

This project is finished by myself independently for several hours. CodePath's turorial is very helpful.

What's next?
1. Storing to-do list with SQLite
2. Change items from simple strings to a class with description, date and more.
3. Customize UI to make the app more polished.
